Leveraging Multi-grained Sentiment Lexicon Information for Neural Sequence Models
Yan Zeng, Yangyang Lan, Yazhou Hao, Chen Li, Qinhua Zheng

In this paper, I carefully collected a Sentiment Lexicon, and I tried to make it larger.
Finally, it consists of: 
1) 5106 negative words and 2759 positive words majorly collected from the 2 links below.
  Subjectivity Lexicon (https://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/lexicons/subj_lexicon/)
  Opinion lexicon (https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html)

2) 33 negation words and 62 intensifiers collected manually.
  In this repository, we release these two part of our Sentiment Lexicon. 
  You can easily download the other through the above 2 links.

All phases are changed into the form of 'a-b', e.g. 'without-doubt'(intensifier), '2-faced'(negative).
