Leveraging Multi-grained Sentiment Lexicon Information for Neural Sequence Models
Yan Zeng, Yangyang Lan, Yazhou Hao, Chen Li

In this paper, I carefully collected a Sentiment Lexicon, and I tried to make it larger.
Finally, it consists of: 
1) 5111 negative words and 2759 positive words collected from the 2 links below.
  Subjectivity Lexicon (https://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/lexicons/subj_lexicon/)
  Opinion lexicon (https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html)

2) 35 negation words and 62 intensifiers collected manually.
  In this repository, we release these two part of our Sentiment Lexicon. 
  You can easily download the other through the above 2 links.

This repertory aims to save your time to do repetitive work and promote further research in Sentiment Classification. 
Even with the simple and general method proposed in our paper, sequence models can gain performance improvement.
